<p>##Provisioning</p>

<p>You could do this manually but downloading whatever you need using package managers like apt-get etc. This is fine, but there are two important reasons why this probably isn’t the best way to go.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To perform tasks like installing new software you will have to have root access. At the moment you are logged in as a user called Vagrant, not Root. You can change this easily enough, however, by typing:</p>

    <p>sudo su</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the biggie. If you install things by hand then when you destroy your virtual machine (which you will do, often) then everything you have installed will disappear with it. You will have to re-install everything <em>every</em> time you startup a new VM. Bad times.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So what’s the answer? It’s called <strong>Provisioning</strong> and it means that you have some sort of config file saved that Vagrant can run a series of commands and install everything you need <em>each time you start a new VM</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is where things start to get (for me at least) a bit tricky. There are various options, but it took me quite sometime to get this setup correctly.</p>

<p>From what I can gather there are three main ways of provisioning a VM using Vagrant (not including writing a bash script - see the vagrant docs for info on this):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Puppet</li>
  <li>Chef</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ol>

<p>I think that they all do basically the same thing, but in slightly different ways. I’ve tried playing with Puppet but whilst asking for some help on the Vagrant irc channel I was recommended Salt which is what I’ll be talking about now. Puppet and Chef both use Ruby, so if that’s your thing then go for that. Salt uses files written in the YAML format which I personally find much easier to understand. It is also used a lot in Symfony2 and Doctrine which I will be discussing later on in this series.</p>

<h3 id="salt-stack">Salt Stack</h3>
<p>So, let’s get going with Salt. Much of what follows is based on work done by <a href="http://geoffpetrie.com">Geoff Petrie</a> and his freely available github repository to build a PHP Lamp stack using Vagrant and Salt that you can find <a href="https://github.com/geopet/salt-lamp-vagrant">here</a>. If you like you can follow the instructions in his github repo readme and you’ll have a fully working LAMP stack, however if you want to walk through with me and learn what he’s done, then carry on reading.</p>

<p>The good news is that Vagrant (as of version 1.3) has native support for Salt. If for some reason you’re running an older version either upgrade or install the vagrant-salty plugin. Google will help you out with either of these two things.</p>

<p>Next up, create a new folder to keep all of our SaltStack stuff and a subfolder called “roots”.<br />
	$ mkdir salt<br />
	$ cd salt<br />
    	$ mkdir roots</p>

<p>Now let’s think for a moment what we are trying to achieve. We need to set up Salt so that everytime we start a new VM using Vagrant we know that the new machine will be automatically provisioned with everything <em>exactly</em> how we’ve specified previously. There’s a lovely description about this in the <a href="http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/index.htm">SaltStack docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>State management, also frequently called software configuration management (SCM), is a program that puts and keeps a system into a predetermined state. It installs software packages, starts or restarts services, or puts configuration files in place and watches them for changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Salt uses files called SLS files to store states. You should think of states as simpe data lists. This is why they are written in YAML format. If you haven’t come across YAML before it is a super easy way of writing organised data lists. We need to write a separate state for every component that we want our VM to be provisioned with. Let’s start with a nice easy example. We’re going to write the SLS file for our Apache2 installation.</p>

<p>Open up your IDE or text editor or whatever and create a new file in the roots directory and call it “apache2.sls”. Then copy this:</p>

<pre><code>apache2:
  		pkg:
   			- installed
  		service:
			- running
</code></pre>

<p>Please make sure you have indented the lines correctly because this is fundemental to how YAML works.</p>

<p>The first line is, as you would expect, the name we have given to this set of data. Officially it is called an <em>ID Declaration</em>. It is important that this matches the package name that you are going to install. This is dependent on your operating system and package manager. We are using Ubuntu and apt so if you are using something else then you need to check what the package name needs to be.</p>

<p>The second line is the <em>State Declaration</em>. This tells us what state we are going to use. These are all listed in the docs and you can even create your own, but let’s just stick with what we need for now. You can see now why the indentation is important. By indenting you can clearly see what data is a subset of something else. In our case “pkg” and “service” are indented by the same amount so they are obviously first children of “apache2”. I hope this is fairly self-explanatory.<br />
The state declaration refers to a salt state module. This has several functions built in that do various different things. The third line in our example simply says that we want to use the “installed” function of the “pkg” state module. As you would expect this simply is a check to make sure that the package is installed.</p>

<p>Moving on you can see we use another module called “service”. Here we’ve specified that apache should be started if it is not already running.<br />
And there we are, you’ve just written your first SLS!</p>

<p>The next step is to create a file called top.sls which will work as a master mapping file. Top files come into their own when you want to set up different environments or provision different minions separately. For us it will be very straightforward. Once you’ve created the file (in the salt directory) copy in:</p>

<pre><code>base:
	   '*':
          - apache2
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have created an environment called “base”. Within this environment we are using “*” to match all minions (if you have mulitple minions you might specify specific names instead) and finally we send all minions the apache2 state. Pretty easy, huh?!</p>

<p>We just have one more file to create. In the salt directory created a blank file (make sure it isn’t automatically given the .txt suffix) called “minion”. This is a config file and all it needs in it is:</p>

<pre><code>file_client: local
</code></pre>

<p>By default Salt looks for files on the master server, but because we are going to utilise Vagrant’s ability to sync folders.</p>

<p>The final step is to update our Vagrantfile. Open up your Vagrantfile and add:</p>

  	## For masterless, mount your file roots file root<br />
  	config.vm.synced_folder “salt/roots/”, “/srv/”<br />

<pre><code># Provision using Saltstack
config.vm.provision :salt do |salt|
  
  	salt.minion_config = "salt/minion"
  	salt.run_highstate = true
  
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you Vagrant Up you will have a working Apache server on your VM. However, at the moment we can’t easily test this. We need to add one more thing to our Vagrantfile in order to be able to test in the browser:</p>

<pre><code>config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 4567
</code></pre>

<p>This sets up some port forwarding so that when we go to http://localhost:4567 in our browser we are actually visiting port 80 on the VM. The resuly is that you should see a page that tells you that your Apache server is working!</p>

<p>Time for another cup of tea!</p>

<p>Ok, so we should now be able to use the same techniques to provision our VM with the other components of our LAMP stack - MySQL and PHP. Hopefully you’re ahead of me now and have realised that to do this we need to create two more SLS files. We’ll name them both after the packages we are going to install:<br />
First, PHP. Create a new file in the roots directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ touch libapache2-mod-php5.sls
	$ vim libapache2-mod-php5.sls
</code></pre>

<p>(nb I am using the text editor vim but you can create this file however you choose, just remember to ignore the second line if you’re not using vim!) Then add the following:</p>

<pre><code>libapache2-mod-php5:
		pkg:
    		- installed
</code></pre>

<p>This should look very familiar. Next, we will do the same for MySQL. Create a file called mysql.sls and in it should be:</p>

<pre><code>mysql:
	   pkg:
          - installed
          - names:
        	- mysql-server
            - libapache2-mod-auth-mysql
            - php5-mysql
   service:
          - running
</code></pre>

<p>So, this is a little bit more complex but it shouldn’t phase you. We’re saying that mysql should be installed and running (just like we did with apache). The extra bit is under “names”. This specifies additional packages that also need to be installed in order for this state to be successful. If they are not then Salt will install them.</p>

<p>Finally, we just need to make sure that our top file includes our seperate files. Add them to the top file in just the same way that you did apache2.</p>

<p>So now we should have a full working LAMP stack on our VM.<br />
Destroy your existing VM by typing:</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant destroy
</code></pre>

<p>And build it again by using</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>All being well your VM should boot and provision itself and you’re ready to rock.</p>

<p>Please remember that I am only scraping the surface of what Vagrant and Salt can do but I hope it is enough to get us going. Hopefully I will be able to dive a bit deeper in future articles.</p>

<p>Since writing this article I have come across some GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools that help build your config files to use with Vagrant. I haven’t explored them much yet, but they look good to get you up and running quickly. Check out:<br />
