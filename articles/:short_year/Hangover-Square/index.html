<h3 id="hangover-square-by-patrick-hamilton">Hangover Square by Patrick Hamilton</h3>

<p>I cannot say that I enjoyed reading this novel. At times it was uncomfortable to the point of being painful. When you think the misery and pain can’t tumble any further Hamilton manages to plumb even deeper depths of despair, loneliness and depravity. One becomes as desperate as George Bone himself for everything to come to an end and yet Hamilton forces the reader, and Bone, to put themselves through one more trauma and then one more still.</p>

<p>In the small world based off the Earls Court Road we are shown the cruelty of mankind in all it’s familiar guises and we realise how our relationships with other people are what make us feel human. George’s only true relationship is with his adopted white (pure) cat but even that is bundled up in the misery of place. His only comfort can’t be taken with him. His endless walks alone in the rain reflect his own sense of where his life is but at no point is the reader given any glimmer of hope that things might turn out ok.</p>

<p>It is a brilliantly written novel that uses hugely evocative language that place the reader right at the centre of this man’s small world, both physically and mentally. Although it is desperately sad throughout the reader is left at the end with a sense that things don’t have to be that way. Bone is useless without muscle and tissue and purpose and Hamilton, I think, is urging all of us to not allow our lives to wither and to fully live in the present.</p>
