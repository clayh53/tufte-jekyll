<p>“that in the air between the living, spirits bob and weave and laugh with us. They are the oxygen we breathe.”</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be drawn into this novel just as the hopes and dreams and loves of the small community of people are drawn in and swallowed up by the sink hole that keeps hold of it’s history for ever. The novel starts in a hole in the ground that forever holds it’s secret and the reader is constantly reminded by everything being buried. People bury their feelings, their secrets and their desires. And yet the one thing that isn’t buried is the one thing that is literally under the earth - Susie. She is in the air, dead yet alive, she is the oxygen that everyone breaths and she is also the oxygen that finally leaves her killer.</p>

<p>This is a curious book which manages to keep the reader engaged but can, at times, feel like it’s dragging it’s feet in a blancmange of metaphor. You crave some narrative to replace the imagery just for a moment.</p>

<p>It is touching, moving and thought provoking but manages to avoid sentimentality. After all the trauma and horror one finishes the novel with an uplifting sense that everything will be ok - that life is just part of the journey.</p>
