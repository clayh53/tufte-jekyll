### Catcher In The Rye by J.D. Salinger

At first you would be forgiven for thinking that you had to be the same age as Holden Caulfield to be able to relate to this book - perhaps this is why it is on so many school reading lists. This would be a mistake though. Everyone will be able to have a relationship with Holden regardless of whether or not they can relate directly with his situation. For me, I read the book from the point of view of a parent and my overwhelming feeling was one of sadness for this child who was so desperate. Had my sixteen year old self been reading it then my relationship would have been completely different.

I would recommend everyone to read this book as it is bound to provoke a reaction. You shouldn't expect to empathise with Holden, although of course you might, but you can't escape being affected by his narrative and learning something of what it is like to be a teenager trying to find their way in a big and confusing world. It is as powerful now as it was when first published over 50 years ago.
