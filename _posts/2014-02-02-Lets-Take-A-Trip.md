### Coming along for the ride?

Here we go with the first post in my new series all about web development for non-developers. 
I hope to post as regularly as I can manage and to cover as many topics as I can going into
as much depth as I think is useful at the time. 
I really hope that you will use the comments on each post to ask questions, suggest improvements
and have discussions about the post. With that in mind, don't forget to read the comments after 
each post because they may well contain some really useful bits of information.

My aim with this series is for ask to go hand-in-hand into the world of web development and learn
new skills together as we go. I am not a web professional and lots of the stuff I will be writing 
about I will be experiencing for the first time, just as I hope you will be. I WILL make mistakes
but I hope that together we will all get through them.

### Why am I doing this?

Ok, so let me give you a little bit of background. I'm not a web developer. I'm a professional musician
based just outside of London, UK. Since about 2005 I've been interested in web design and development and
over the years have tinkered around and tried to learn (and retain) as much as I can. However, my problem 
is that with work and family commitments I don't have very much time to devote to my hobby. I try and grab 
20 minutes here and an hour there, but there might be some days I don't open my laptop at all. 
This was ok at first but in the last few years there has been such as massive acceleration in web technologies
that trying to keep up with best practices has become almost impossible. Even when I do get my head around something 
new if I don't use it for a few weeks or months because I'm focussing on something else then I've invariably forgotten
everything I learnt in the first place.

So, this on-going series of posts is for me just as much as for you. I'm going to start right at the very
beginning talking about development tools and workflows before moving on to working through an example project.
It's all fairly standard tutorial stuff but the difference is that I won't be writing from the point of view of 
an expert who uses this stuff every day. I will be learning and making mistakes as I go. I hope that everything will be
documented. This way it will become an invaluable resource for me to keep track of my progress as well as hopefully
being a useful path for you to follow along and contribute to.

I've written up a very quick [roadmap] with some ideas of things I would like to cover but this will almost
certainly change and be updated as we go!

Please be aware that once we get as far as building applications I will *mainly* be talking about PHP as this
is the language I have most experience of. Obviously I will talk about HTML, CSS and javascript and maybe further 
down the line look at some client-side libraries for building dynamic websites (Backbone.js, Angular.js etc) but 
that won't be for a while yet.
It would be really beneficial if you could get the basics of HTML, CSS and PHP down because although I will go
as slowly as I can there simply won't be time to go into absolute minute detail about everything.
I will try and keep a [links] page updated with links to other sites that I have found useful for covering stuff
either in advance or stuff you want more detail on.

### If you're sitting comfortably then I'll begin

So finally, a big thank you for joining me on this adventure. I'm really excited to write regularly and discover
new things together. Let's go!
